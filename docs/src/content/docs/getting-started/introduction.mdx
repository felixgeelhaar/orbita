# What is Orbita?

Orbita is a **CLI-first adaptive productivity operating system** designed for developers and power users who want to take control of their time without leaving the terminal.

Unlike traditional productivity tools that require constant attention, Orbita works **autonomously** in the background, intelligently scheduling your tasks, habits, and meetings while respecting your preferences and constraints.

## Core Philosophy

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Autonomy over Configuration" icon="rocket">
    Orbita works out of the box. No extensive setup required - install and start being productive immediately.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Adaptation over Rigidity" icon="setting">
    The system continuously adjusts to your behavior patterns, learning when you're most productive and scheduling accordingly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Determinism over Opaque AI" icon="approve-check">
    Scheduling logic is predictable and transparent. AI supports your decisions but never makes them for you.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI-First Design" icon="laptop">
    Every feature is accessible from the command line. Integrate with your existing terminal workflow seamlessly.
