# Conflict Resolution

When Orbita blocks conflict with external calendar events, Orbita detects and resolves them.

## Conflict Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Overlap** | External event overlaps with Orbita block |
| **Modified** | Orbita event modified in external calendar |
| **Deleted** | Orbita event deleted in external calendar |

## Resolution Strategies

### Time First (Default)

Earlier-scheduled item wins:

```yaml
calendar:
  conflict_strategy: time_first
```

### Orbita Wins

Orbita blocks always take priority:

```yaml
calendar:
  conflict_strategy: orbita_wins
```

### External Wins

External events take priority, Orbita reschedules:

```yaml
calendar:
  conflict_strategy: external_wins
```

### Manual

Mark conflicts for manual review:

```yaml
calendar:
  conflict_strategy: manual
```

## Managing Conflicts

### View Conflicts

```bash
orbita conflicts show
```

### Resolve Interactively

```bash
orbita conflicts resolve
```

Options:
- **Reschedule** - Move Orbita block
- **Keep Both** - Allow overlap
- **Ignore** - Mark as resolved

### Auto-Resolve

```bash
orbita conflicts resolve --auto
```

## Best Practices

1. Check conflicts daily
2. Use `time_first` for mixed workflows
3. Leave buffer time around external events
4. Review conflict history weekly

## Debugging

```bash
# See conflict history
orbita conflicts history

# Check sync logs
orbita logs --component calendar
```
