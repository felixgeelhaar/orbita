# AI Integration

Orbita is AI-native with full MCP (Model Context Protocol) support.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and services. Orbita's MCP server exposes your productivity system to AI assistants like Claude.

## Setting Up

### 1. Start the MCP Server

```bash
orbita mcp serve
```

The server runs on `localhost:3333` by default.

### 2. Configure Your AI Assistant

#### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/.config/claude/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "orbita": {
      "command": "orbita",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## What You Can Do

With MCP enabled, you can use natural language:

- "Create a task to review the PR by tomorrow"
- "What's on my schedule for today?"
- "Log my meditation habit"
- "Add a topic for my 1:1 with Sarah"
- "Show me my task completion rate this week"

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `task_create` | Create tasks |
| `task_list` | List tasks |
| `task_complete` | Complete tasks |
| `schedule_show` | View schedule |
| `habit_log` | Log habits |
| `meeting_topic` | Add meeting topics |
| `insights_get` | Get analytics |

## Privacy

- MCP runs locally
- Data stays on your machine
- AI sees only what you request

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Starting

```bash
orbita mcp status
```

### Connection Issues

Ensure the server is running:

```bash
orbita mcp serve --verbose
```
