# ORBITA – VISION

## The Adaptive Productivity OS (CLI-first)

## Vision

Orbita is the adaptive productivity operating system that plans, protects, and evolves how people spend their time.

Orbita is intentionally **CLI-first**, evolving into a full SaaS once the domain, automation, and intelligence are proven.

Orbita replaces manual planning with autonomous orchestration of tasks, calendars, habits, and meetings — adapting continuously as reality changes.

Orbita is not a to-do list.
Orbita is not a calendar.
Orbita is not a chat-first AI.

Orbita is the **system of record for intent and time**.

## Why CLI-first

Starting with a CLI allows Orbita to:

- Validate the hardest problems first (scheduling, adaptation)
- Avoid premature UX and visual complexity
- Force clean domain modeling (DDD)
- Attract high-signal power users early
- Ship faster with lower cost and risk

The CLI is not a temporary hack — it is a permanent power interface.

## Problem

Modern productivity fails because:

- Work is fragmented across tools
- Calendars are reactive instead of intentional
- Tasks ignore available time
- Habits collapse under real schedules
- Meetings drift without feedback
- Tools do not adapt to behavior

The problem is not lack of features — it is excess decision-making.

## Insight

- Time is the scarce resource
- Behavior matters more than plans
- Change is constant
- Different users need different levels of power

## Principles

- Autonomy over configuration
- Adaptation over rigidity
- Modularity over bloat
- Determinism over opaque AI
- Calm over urgency
- CLI as a first-class interface

## Outcomes

### For users

- Less anxiety
- Fewer decisions
- Higher follow-through

### For the business

- Faster validation
- Modular revenue growth
- Low operational overhead
