  </Card>
  <Card title="Organize" icon="list-format">
    Categorize tasks by priority, duration, and context. Let Orbita's scheduling engine do the heavy lifting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review" icon="approve-check">
    Regular reviews keep you aligned with your goals. Daily, weekly, and monthly review support built-in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Execute" icon="rocket">
    Focus on the task at hand. Orbita ensures you're always working on the right thing at the right time.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Creating Tasks

### Quick Capture

```bash
# Minimal task creation
orbita task create "Buy groceries"

# With priority and duration
orbita task create "Prepare presentation" -p high -d 60

# With due date
orbita task create "Submit report" --due 2025-01-25

# With tags
orbita task create "Review PR #123" --tags work,code-review
```

### Task Attributes

| Attribute | Flag | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Title | (positional) | Task description |
| Priority | `-p`, `--priority` | `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| Duration | `-d`, `--duration` | Estimated time in minutes |
| Due Date | `--due` | Deadline (YYYY-MM-DD or relative) |
| Tags | `--tags` | Comma-separated labels |
| Notes | `--notes` | Additional details |
| Project | `--project` | Associated project |

### Relative Due Dates

```bash
orbita task create "Task" --due today
orbita task create "Task" --due tomorrow
orbita task create "Task" --due "next monday"
orbita task create "Task" --due "in 3 days"
```

## Task Lifecycle

<Steps>
1. **Pending** - Task is created and waiting to be scheduled
2. **Scheduled** - Orbita has allocated time for the task
3. **In Progress** - You've started working on the task
4. **Completed** - Task is done
5. **Archived** - Task is removed from active lists
</Steps>

```bash
# Start working on a task
orbita task start <id>

# Complete a task
orbita task complete <id>

# Archive a completed task
orbita task archive <id>
```

## Viewing Tasks

### List All Tasks

```bash
# All pending tasks
orbita task list

# Filtered by status
orbita task list --status pending
orbita task list --status completed

# Filtered by priority
orbita task list --priority high

# Filtered by tag
orbita task list --tag work

# Combined filters
orbita task list --priority high --tag work --status pending
```

### Task Details

```bash
orbita task show <id>
```

Output:
```
Task: abc123
Title: Prepare quarterly presentation
Status: scheduled

```

## Updating Tasks

```bash
# Update title
orbita task update <id> --title "New title"

# Change priority
orbita task update <id> --priority high

# Adjust duration
orbita task update <id> --duration 45

# Add tags
orbita task update <id> --add-tag urgent

# Remove tags
orbita task update <id> --remove-tag optional

# Update due date
orbita task update <id> --due "next friday"
```

## Task Priority System

Orbita uses a three-tier priority system:

| Priority | Description | Scheduling Behavior |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **High** | Critical tasks that must be done | Scheduled first, protected time |
| **Medium** | Important but flexible tasks | Scheduled around high priority |
| **Low** | Nice-to-have tasks | Fills remaining time slots |

<Aside type="tip">
  Keep high-priority tasks to 1-3 per day for realistic scheduling.
</Aside>

## Automatic Scheduling

When you create a task, Orbita automatically:

1. **Finds an optimal slot** based on priority and duration
2. **Respects constraints** like work hours and existing events
3. **Applies preferences** like ideal work times
4. **Creates a time block** in your schedule

```bash
# Create task - automatically scheduled
orbita task create "Deep work session" -p high -d 120

# View where it's scheduled
orbita schedule show
```

### Manual Scheduling Override

```bash
# Schedule at specific time
orbita task schedule <id> --time "2025-01-22 14:00"

# Reschedule
orbita task reschedule <id> --time "2025-01-23 10:00"
```

## Task Projects

Group related tasks into projects:

```bash
# Create a project
orbita project create "Website Redesign"

# Add task to project
orbita task create "Design mockups" --project "Website Redesign"

# View project tasks
orbita project show "Website Redesign"
```

## Recurring Tasks

For tasks that repeat:

```bash
# Daily recurring task
orbita task create "Check email" --recur daily -d 15

# Weekly task
orbita task create "Team standup prep" --recur "weekly monday"

# Custom recurrence
orbita task create "Review metrics" --recur "every 2 weeks"
```

## Task Templates

Create templates for common tasks:

```bash
# Create a template
orbita template create "PR Review" -d 30 --tags code-review

# Create task from template
orbita task create --from-template "PR Review" "Review PR #456"
```

## Bulk Operations

```bash
# Complete multiple tasks
orbita task complete abc123 def456 ghi789

# Archive all completed tasks
orbita task archive --completed

# Update priority for multiple tasks
orbita task update --tag urgent --priority high
```

## Integration with Schedule

Tasks flow into your schedule automatically:

```bash
# View today's scheduled tasks
orbita schedule today

# See task in schedule context
orbita schedule show --highlight-task <id>

# Optimize task placement
orbita schedule optimize
```

## Task Analytics

```bash
# View task completion stats
orbita insights tasks

# Daily summary
orbita insights today --tasks

# Weekly review
orbita insights week --tasks
```

Output:
```
Task Insights (Last 7 Days)

## Best Practices

### Effective Task Capture

- **Be specific**: "Review PR #123" not "Review code"
- **Include duration**: Helps scheduling be more accurate
- **Use consistent tags**: Create a tagging system and stick to it
- **Set realistic due dates**: Orbita works better with real deadlines

### Priority Guidelines

- **High**: Must be done today, blocks other work
- **Medium**: Important but can wait a day or two
- **Low**: Would be nice to do when time permits

### Daily Review

```bash
# Morning routine
orbita schedule today              # See your day
orbita task list --priority high   # Check critical tasks

# Evening routine
orbita task list --status pending  # Review remaining
orbita insights today              # See accomplishments
```
